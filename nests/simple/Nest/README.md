# Nest for Swift scripts in a clutch

This is an example project with one demo script
invoked using [clutch](https://github.com/wti/clutch.git).

1. Build clutch and install the executable on your PATH.
2. Move this package to `$HOME/git/Nest`
3. Edit and then run the sample script: [Samples/demo.swift](Samples/demo.swift)

It should rebuild and run automatically, updating the source in
[Sources/demo/main.swift](Sources/demo/main.swift).

Next, copy `sample/demo.swift` anywhere on your system and rename it.
When you run it, clutch creates new target with the source.

See clutch for more details.
